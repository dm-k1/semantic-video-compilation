# Process Outline

This document provides a high-level outline of the research process for academic review.

## Scope

- The repository is shared as an admissions review artifact.
- The notebook and scripts are presented to illustrate the analytical sequence.

## Process Stages

1. Video normalization and metadata sanitization.
2. Frame extraction at a fixed sampling rate.
3. CLIP-based semantic scoring of frames against curated statements.
4. Aggregation of frame scores into video-level representations.
5. SVD-based reweighting and dimensionality reduction.
6. Prototype-based strata construction.
7. Compilation selection and statistical validation.
